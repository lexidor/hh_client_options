# Lexidor/hh_client_options

This project attempts to push the Hack/hhvm ecosystem forward by tracking the support for the stricter hh_client options. Hack is by default decently strict, but projects may decide to restrict themselves to a stricter subset of Hack, in exchange for better typing. However, when a dependency (first or third party) does not meet these stricter requirements, the typechecker errors on those dependencies. This project tries to find the set of options that all\* oss project adhere to, as a common baseline. I will also be making contributions to those oss projects, to try and allow more options to be a baseline.

### Adding your own projects

If you believe that the stricter hh_client options are providing value, you may decide to add your project (or a project you use) to the composer.json file. That way, I'll be warned about incompatibilities with these projects. I might even chip in to make your project meet the requirements for these options.

### How to get started

At the root of this project, you;ll find the `.hhconfig` file. The options that are set in there have been found to work for all the listed dependencies. You can copy these options as a base for you own project, removing those that you don't care about, without fear that a library will not support these options.

For the full list of checked libraries, see composer.json.

#### Footnote

This project intentionally depends on the bleeding edge. If you are not able/willing to run hhvm-latest and/or some projects `dev-master`, you might find that some options don't work for you yet.

#### Experimental

hhast-lint support

Copy paste this into the console to strip out all the `<?php` files.
https://github.com/hhvm/hhast/issues/290

find . -wholename "**/ComposerPlugin.php" -type f -delete
find . -wholename "**/autoload_files.php" -type f -delete

I have published the location of all lint errors in all dependencies.
The idea is not to fix all of them.
The idea is that we'll be able to diff the lint errors right before pushing a linter to hhast master.
That way we can check how many lint error would occur in oss libs, before releasing the linter.
